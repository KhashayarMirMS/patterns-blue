# Activate the builtin filters of your eyes

Your eyes are the gateway of light. You can manipulate the gateway to receive different amounts of light waves.
### Eyes half closed

When observing for color and contrast, It usually helps that you make your eyes half closed.
This results is like having a [low pass filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter) on your eyes.
This also helps you focus on the wholistic attributes of the color field.
You can also achieve this effect, with gaussian blur filter.

### Eyes wide open

This helps you absorb details and hairlines better.
Little dots of color could have great impact over the feeling of the color field.
