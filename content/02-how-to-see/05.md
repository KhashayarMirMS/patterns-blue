# You are the measuring device

When deciding between two different color choices,
whether it's choosing the color of a flower in your painting or just choosing between two shirt colors,
asking your self this question could help a lot:
### which one is better mirror of my true self?

This is called the mirror of the self test, which is an essential process of decision making specially with colors.
You put your feelings forward as a measuring instrument of the world.
