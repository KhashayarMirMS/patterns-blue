# A single sensation of color

If you want to observe the inner light phenomenon,
you have to learn to sense a single sensation of the color field.
It helps to think of this phenomenon with the analogy of a music chord.
Of course it's individual notes that buildup the chord, but if you want to
understand the impact of a chord, you would focus a lot on the overall *feeling* of it.
Same is true with color, to sense the whole harmony you have to engage your feelings towards the whole.
