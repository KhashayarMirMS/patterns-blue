### A single sensation of color

If you want to observe the inner light phenomenon,
you have to learn to sense a single sensation of the color field.
It helps to think of this phenomenon with the analogy of a music chord.
Of course it's individual notes that buildup the chord, but if you want to
understand the impact of a chord, you would focus a lot on the overall *feeling* of it.
Same is true with color, to sense the whole harmony you have to engage your feelings towards the whole.

Recall a time when you've been to a beautiful part of nature, could be a forest, a beach or anywhere else
you would feel most connected to the world. Now try to imagine the quality of the main colors you're perceiving.
The mature greenness of forest, the mysterious deep blue of the ocean, the silence yellow of the desert.
That is the quality of inner light, a harmonious color field that touches the soul.
